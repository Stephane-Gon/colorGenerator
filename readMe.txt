============= COLOR GENERATOR ==================

  So this was my first project using Typescript, it is a really simple project but good
to start learning typescript.

  1º I created the html that consists of:
    1.1º A main grid that's 5 x 5;
    1.2º A Button;
    1.3º A secondary grid that's 5 x 1;

  2º After that I created a function that generates a random color for each cell in the main grid (20);

  3º I added an eventListener to the button with this function so the user can generate more random colors without reloading;

  4º I added functionality so the user can copy one of the colors from the main grid into one of the 5 cells 
  in the secondary grid;

  5º And finnaly I added functionality so the user can lock the colors from the main grid
  so when he generates new colors the locked one will stay there;
